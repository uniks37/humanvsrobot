Execution Ground Rules:
There are 2 files provided with codes -
1) ExecuterMain.ipynb - It is an intelligent python notebook that can be opened using jupyter-notebook.
2) ExecuterMain.py - It is a python code version and can be directly executed from terminal. But, each pass requires entire execution of the file.
3) format.txt - Contains the test labels.

**Notes**
Merging functions require 2 hours to execute at first, but to ease the time required, the whole fused dataset is stored in a file. Due to its enormous size, we are not uploading them but, they will be automatically created once the program executes.

Software Requirements-
python 3.6 with pip3, sklearn, imbalearn, pandas, numpy installed in the execution environment. All of the above libraries MUST BE present.
train, bids and test files MUST BE present in the /dataset folder.

Failing to have the above in the exact order will prevent the execution of the code.

Ways to execute - 
In anaconda, open with jupyter notebook
On console type in python3 ExecuterMain.py or py ExecuterMain.py.
