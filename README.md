With increasing intervention of non-human bidders(bots) on online bidding websites, human bidders started becoming more and more frustrated with their inability to win against them. To develop a fair and trustworthy online bidding platform, the respective website owners need to get rid of the computer-generated bidding or bidders (bots). Classical models which use behavioral data such as bid frequency over a short period fell short in front of the modern and evolving workarounds. Our aim is to predict such imposter bots with better precision and speed. This becomes more interesting as there is not much line of differentiation between those two.
